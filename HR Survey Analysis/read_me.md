## Project: Employee Job Satisfaction Survey
### Overview:
The city recently conducted a survey with approximately 1,500 employees to measure job satisfaction and uncover key factors that contribute to staff motivation and engagement. This initiative aims to gather valuable insights that will help city leadership understand the strengths and areas for improvement in the workplace, ensuring a positive work environment and enhancing employee retention.

### Objectives:
* Measure Job Satisfaction: Explore, analyze and QA the data by calculating basic profiling metrics, removing blank and duplicate records, and standardizing inconsistent text fields.
* Identify Motivational Drivers: Discover what motivates employees and drives engagement, including professional development opportunities, recognition, and work-life balance.
* Visualize the data and summarize findings: visualize the data using stacked bar charts and Likert scales, and derive insights and recommendations to share with the HR leadership team based on your findings.
* Formulate Actionable Strategies: Based on survey results, develop targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction, foster a supportive workplace culture, and retain talent.

### Outcomes:
* Detailed Analysis: A thorough analysis of the survey responses will be conducted, breaking down the data by various demographics (e.g., department, role, tenure) to identify trends and patterns.
* Actionable Insights: The results will inform decision-making around policy improvements, employee development programs, and initiatives to enhance engagement and motivation.
* Ongoing Monitoring: Based on findings, the city will implement ongoing tracking of employee satisfaction to measure the effectiveness of the changes made and continuously refine engagement strategies.

### Expected Impact:
This survey will empower the city to create a more engaging and supportive work environment, improving employee morale, increasing productivity, and ensuring that staff feel valued and motivated in their roles. It will also serve as a foundation for future employee engagement initiatives and guide the city in retaining top talent.
